    <h2>Understanding Course Enrollment</h2>
    <p>Course enrollment is the process by which students register for classes offered by an educational institution. It involves selecting specific courses from a catalog, adding them to a schedule, and confirming enrollment in each course.</p>
    <p>Course enrollment typically occurs before the start of each academic term, allowing students to plan their schedules and ensure they meet degree requirements. During enrollment, students may need to consider prerequisites, class availability, and scheduling conflicts.</p>
    <p>For institutions, managing course enrollment involves creating course catalogs, setting enrollment deadlines, and monitoring class capacities. Enrollment data helps institutions plan course offerings, allocate resources, and assess student demand for different subjects.</p>
    <p>In summary, course enrollment is a crucial aspect of academic life, facilitating the organization and delivery of educational programs for students and institutions alike.</p>
